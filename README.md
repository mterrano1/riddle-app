# Phase-1-Project

Introduction
------------

Welcome to my second Flatiron School project! Sometimes I feel like I'm trying to solve riddles when I'm staring at code for so long and trying to get something to work. Sometimes I get frustrated, and sometimes I get inspiration for a new project! My requirements for this project were:

-Create a Single Page Application using React
-It must contain a minimum of five components
-It must contain a minimum of three client-side routes
-It must make a GET & POST fetch request to a JSON server


I hope you enjoy viewing my riddle app as much as I enjoyed making it!


Description
-----------

-To view the riddles, click on the button that says: 'Get started'

-Now you will see a list 10 riddles on the screen for you to try and solve. Below each riddle are two buttons. If you click on the button that says 'Need a hint,' an alert will pop up on your screen providing you with a hint to help you solve the riddle. If you think you know the answer or you want to see if your answer is correct the click on the button that says 'Answer.' This will render a new component showing you the answer to that riddle.

-If you'd like to contribute to the list of riddles, click on the 'Add new riddle' tab in the Navigation Bar at the top of the page. This will take you to a form where you can enter your own riddle title, question, hint, and answer. Once you've entered all of your riddle information, click on the button that says 'submit' and your riddle will be posted to the db.json, you'll be programmatically navigated back to the riddles component, and you should see your new riddle on the page with all of the others.

-If you're really feeling adventerous, feel free to take a crack at the riddle challenge by clicking on the tab in the navigation bar that says 'Challenge.' The challenge is to answer as many riddles as you can in the allotted time. As soon as you run out of time, you will see 'Correct' render below the question if you answered the riddle correctly, or you will see 'The correct answer is: {whatever the answer is}.'
